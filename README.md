# ArcGIS Maps SDK for Flutter Samples

This repository contains Flutter sample code demonstrating the capabilities of ArcGIS Maps SDK for Flutter and how to use them in your own app. This SDK enables development of cross-platform GIS apps for mobile devices running iOS and Android.

## Run the samples using the Beta package of ArcGIS Maps SDK for Flutter

Visit [earlyadopter.esri.com](https://earlyadopter.esri.com/) and download the ArcGIS Maps SDK for Flutter package. Follow the instructions to unpack it.

Clone or download this repository into the same parent directory as the `arcgis_maps_package`. Your file structure should be:

```
parent_directory
   |
   |__ arcgis-maps-sdk-flutter-samples
   |
   |__ arcgis_maps_package
```

Navigate to the `arcgis-maps-sdk-flutter-samples` directory.

```
cd arcgis-maps-sdk-flutter-samples
```

Use `flutter pub upgrade` to configure the dependencies.

```
flutter pub upgrade
```

Install arcgis_maps_core.

```
dart run arcgis_maps install
```

Now you are ready to run the samples app!

## Running the Samples app

The app can be run on an iOS or Android simulator or device. Note: you will need to configure an API key to take full advantage of the samples in the app. See [Configuring API Keys](#configuring-api-keys).

- Open the flutter project in VSCode
- Ensure a simulator is running or a device is connected to your development machine 
- Open the "Run and Debug" sidebar
- Select which device or simulator you wish to use in the lower right corner of the VSCode window
- Select "Samples (debug or release)"
  - Note that "Samples (release)" can only be run on a device
- Click the run button or press F5

## Running individual samples

Individual samples can also be run on an iOS or Android simulator or device.

- Open the flutter project in VSCode
- Ensure a simulator is running or a device is connected to your development machine
- Select which device or simulator you wish to use in the lower right corner of the VSCode window
- To run from VSCode, open a sample file from `/lib/src/samples` e.g. `display_map.dart` and click `run` above the `main()` method
- Or run from the command line with `flutter run lib/src/samples/display_map.dart`

## Configuring API Keys

To take full advantage of the samples in the app, you will need to generate an API Key access token. Follow the [Create an API Key](https://links.esri.com/create-an-api-key) tutorial. Ensure that you set the **Location services** privileges to **Basemap, Geocoding, and Routing**. Copy the API key as it will be used in the next step.

Add the new API Key directly to [main.dart](lib/main.dart) or create an environment JSON file that can be loaded with the `--dart-define-from-file` `flutter run` command line argument.

The JSON file itself should be of the format:

```
{
    "API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
}
```

To run using the JSON file to define your API key:

```
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=path/to/json/file.json
```

Or to run an individual sample:

```
flutter run lib/src/samples/display_map.dart --dart-define-from-file=path/to/json/file.json
```
