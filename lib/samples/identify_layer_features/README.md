# Identify layer features

Identify features in all layers in a map.

## Use case

`IdentifyLayers` allows users to tap on a map, returning features at that location across multiple layers. Because some layer types have sublayers, the sample recursively counts results for sublayers within each layer.

## How to use the sample

Tap to identify features. An alert will show all layers with features under the cursor, as well as a layer count.

## How it works

1. The tapped position is passed to `ArcGISMapViewController.identifyLayers`.
2. For each `IdentifyLayerResult` in the results, features are counted.

Note: there is one identify result per layer with matching features; if the feature count is 0, that means a sublayer contains the matching features.

## Relevant API

* ArcGISMapViewController.identifyLayers
* IdentifyLayerResult
* IdentifyLayerResult.layerContent.name
* IdentifyLayerResult.sublayerResults

## Additional information

The GeoView supports two methods of identify: `identifyLayer()`, which identifies features within a specific layer, and `identifyLayers()`, which identifies features for all layers in the current view.
